VAE as GAN's Generator | GAN-Discriminator as VAE's Loss Measurement
By Mo Wentao @MatthewL
This code is based on github.com/seangal/dcgan_vae_pytorch and is referred to
github.com/zhangqianhui/vae-gan-tensorflow/, while both implementation
is somewhat broken and not correct, and the original paper is arxiv.org/abs/1512.09300
We corrected the code and increased stability of training and offered option to
make the discriminator a (could be pretrained) resNet/squeezeNet/denseNet, which
in the contrast is proved not so useful to train generator, also we compared the
optimizers on VAE/GAN, and only Adam series optimizer works fine, while (Nesterov or
naive) SGD converge very slowly and RMSprop quite slower than Adam.
After about 700 epochs on Tesla V100 (Huawei Cloud), the result model is obtained
with fair quality of generated images.
